/*
 * Also, notice the use of "function prototypes", which look like the following
 * and appear at the top of the source code file. They instruct the compiler that
 * we will have functions with these names, parameter lists, etc. That way, you
 * can place the three functions in any order down the page. Without function
 * prototypes you have to be sure that the code for a function is given above any
 * other function which calls the first function. Since that can be confusing to
 * keep track of, function prototypes are highly recommended.
